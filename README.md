# Basics_of_dataScience_Iris_dataset
Key points to remember about EDA (iris dataset).

Data Science is an art of extracting knowledge from data using statistics, various analytics etc.

Data Analysis

               2.Data Acquisition(Getting the data)                                                                                       
               3.Data Wrangling(Cleaning or preprocessing)                                                                                 
               4.Exploratory Data Analysis(Explore, select sutiable model)                                                                 
               5.Data exploration(build model)                                                                                             
               6.prediction                                                                                                               
With an example:-
               1.Problem:- To predict weather a given flower belongs to one of the three types of iris flower family (setosa, verginica, versicolor).                                                                                                                                              2.Data Acquisition                                                                                                         
                 Here we already have iris data set.                                                                                                        Iris data set was ceated by Fisher in 1936. These days, it got a lot of fame.
